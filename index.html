        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>
            It is refreshing to finally see an official resin statue of the Knight. However, I must warn that the the quality is very iffy and the figure is fragile. My first statue came out of the box with his feet completely severed, detached from his stand, snapped off at the base, utterly broken. There were tons of scuffs and scratches on the surface of the resin as well. Note: it was *much worse* than the images shown here of potential quality issues. I received defective product.
